    "##### Compound Interest\n",
    "1. In finance, the formula for compound interest refers to the total amount of principal ($P$) invested, plus annual interest rate of $i$ compounded (usually annually) over  number of time periods $n$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as \n",
    "$$ A = P \\cdot (1+i) ^ n $$   \n",
    "where $A$ is the final balance. Using the above expression, calculate the final balance on a $100,000 investment with 5% interest compounding annually over a 12 year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compound interest can also be calculated using the following [recurrence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation):  \n",
    "$$ A_0 = P $$\n",
    "$$ A_{t+1} = (1 + i) \\cdot A_t $$  \n",
    "That is to say, the amount at time $t=0$ is just the starting principal, $P$, and at each future time $t+1$, is just the one plus the interest rate multiplied by the amount at the previous time period, $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    " Given the above, write a recursive function to calculate the final balance which takes the parameters $P$, $i$, and $n$ as input. Use this function to also provide the answer to question 1 above and check that they match.\n",

    "https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/zju/math/recursion.html\n",
    "3. Another recurrence relation is that of the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), which describes population growth. The population at time $n+1$, expressed as a fraction of the maximum population that can be sustained by the environment, is the product of the rate of reproduction ($r$), and growth and starvation components based upon the population at previous time $n$:  \n",
